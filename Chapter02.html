            <p>“Nowhere in particular,” I said.
                “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”

            “So what’s the point, then?” You
                asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my
                experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”

            “Not so!” I said. “You have within
                you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t
                remember them right now.”

            I stopped walking and took you by
                the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you
                can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you
                are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or
                cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it
                back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.

            “You’ve been in a human for the
                last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your
                immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start
                remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”

            “How many times have I been
                reincarnated, then?”

            “Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to
                lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese
                peasant girl in 540 AD.”

            “Wait, what?” You stammered.
                “You’re sending me back in time?”

            “Well, I guess technically. Time,
                as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come
                from.”

            “Where you come from?” You said.

            “Oh sure,” I explained “I come
                from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll
                want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”

            “Oh,” you said, a little let down.
                “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have
                interacted with myself at some point.”

            “Sure. Happens all the time. And
                with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s
                happening.”

            “So what’s the point of it all?”

            “Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously?
                You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”

            “Well it’s a reasonable question,”
                you persisted.

            I looked you in the eye. “The
                meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”

            “You mean mankind? You want us to
                mature?”

            “No, just you. I made this whole
                universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger
                and greater intellect.”

            “Just me? What about everyone else?”</p>
