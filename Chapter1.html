           <p> You were on your way home when you
                died.

            It was a car accident. Nothing
                particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two
                children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried
                their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you
                were better off, trust me.

            And that’s when you met me.

            “>What… what happened?” You asked.
            “Where am I?”

            “You died,” I said,
                matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.

            “There was a… a truck and it was
                skidding…”

            “Yup,” I said.

            “I… I died?”

            “Yup. But don’t feel bad about it.
                Everyone dies,” I said.

            You looked around. There was
                nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the
                afterlife?”

            “More or less,” I said.

            “Are you god?” You asked.

            “Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”

            “My kids… my wife,” you said.

            “What about them?”

            “Will they be all right?”

            “That’s what I like to see,” I
                said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good
                stuff right there.”

            You looked at me with fascination.
                To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a
                woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher
                than the almighty.

            “Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be
                fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have
                time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be
                secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any
                consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”

            “Oh,” you said. “So what happens
                now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”

            “Neither,” I said. “You’ll be
                reincarnated.”

            “Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus
                were right,”

            “All religions are right in their
                own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”

            You followed along as we strode
               through the void. “Where are we going?”</p>
