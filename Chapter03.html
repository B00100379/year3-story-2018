            “There is no one else,” I said.
                “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”

            You stared blankly at me. “But all
                the people on earth…”

            “All you. Different incarnations
                of you.”

            “Wait. I’m <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>everyone</i>!?”

            “Now you’re getting it,” I said,
                with a congratulatory slap on the back.

            “I’m every human being who ever
                lived?”

            “Or who will ever live, yes.”

            “I’m Abraham Lincoln?”

            “And you’re John Wilkes Booth,
                too,” I added.

            “I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.

            “And you’re the millions he
                killed.”

            “I’m Jesus?”

            “And you’re everyone who followed
                him.”

            You fell silent.

            “Every time you victimized
                someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve
                done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by
                any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”

            You thought for a long time.

            “Why?” You asked me. “Why do all
                this?”

            “Because someday, you will become
                like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”

            “Whoa,” you said, incredulous.
                “You mean I’m a god?”

            “No. Not yet. You’re a fetus.
                You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time,
                you will have grown enough to be born.”

            “So the whole universe,” you said,
                “it’s just…”

            “An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s
                time for you to move on to your next life.”

            And I sent you on your way.
